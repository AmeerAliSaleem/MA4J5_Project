# Predicting Amazon Kindle review scores with TensorFlow
This GitHub repository contains all the work related to my MA4J5 NLP TensorFlow project. Below is a description of the main files:
* 'Kindle data pre-processing.ipynb': contains code for scraping the 5-core Amazon Kindle review data, as well as some handling of class imbalance.
* 'Ameer_Ali_Saleem_MA4J5_Main_Project.ipynb': contains sentiment analysis for full 5-star data.
* 'Ameer_Ali_Saleem_MA4J5_three_class_setup.ipynb': contains sentiment analysis for positve, neutral and negative reviews.
* 'Ameer_Ali_Saleem_MA4J5_binary_class_setup.ipynb': contains sentiment analysis for just positive and negative reviews.

It is recommended that the final three notebooks are opened in Google Colab (links are at the top of each notebook file).
